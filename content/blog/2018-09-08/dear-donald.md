Dear Donald,

Four years ago, you told me to "[Learn To Code](https://www.thehunt.com/the-hunt/XWvoQ4-childish-gambino-learn-to-code-sweatshirt)." This month I will be taking the next step in that journey as I start a full-time program to transition into software engineering.

I wanted to take a moment and express my gratitude for you. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that you have changed my life for the better.

Just before I saw you in concert, I had my first date with the woman who would become my wife. In fact, not only were you part of how we bonded on that first date - you were my opening to ask her out again.

The whole time I would inch closer and closer to learning to code, but never took the plunge. This year that changed. After years of dancing around the topic, I committed that within one year, I’d be working full-time as an engineer.

I spent the summer preparing, and at the end of August, left my job to pursue this transition full time.

I haven’t made it yet. But, more than at any point I can remember, I have clarity on where I’m going and why. Even better, I have best partner in the world along for the journey.

Thank you for that gift and for all that you do. For fans like me, it’s more than you can imagine.

Sincerely,

Stephen
