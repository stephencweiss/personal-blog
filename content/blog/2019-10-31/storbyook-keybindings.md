Filing this under delightful surprises.

I was working with `StorybookJS` today when I stumbled into a few keybindings that I didn't know existed before.

The `/` is labeled on the screen as entering the search window, which I love and use often. I didnâ€™t know about these though:

- `a` - Toggle visibility for the information pane (knobs, readme, etc.)
- `s` - Toggle visibility for the directory list / search (left pane)
- `d` - Toggle position for the information pane (bottom vs right)
- `f` - Toggle full screen.

Here they are in action.

I also found that the comma (`,`) will go to the `about` page for Storybook.
