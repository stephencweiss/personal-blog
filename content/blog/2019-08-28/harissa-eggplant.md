One of our family’s favorite recipes is a Harissa Grilled Eggplant from Goop.<sup>1</sup>

It’s quick, full of flavor, and relatively healthy.

Where the recipe calls for equal parts olive oil and harissa, we adjust to a 1.5:1 to 2:1 ratio in favor of olive oil. More harissa than that is just more heat than we need.

I also tend to skip the yogurt sauce when I'm in a hurry, though it's delicious!

## Ingredient List
* 1/4 cup Harissa
* 1/2 cup Olive oil
* 1 tsp salt

## Steps
1. Combine the harissa, olive oil and salt in a large mixing bowl.
1. Cut the eggplant into thin-ish (~1") slices (The goal is to have all of the eggplant cook evenly and completely so points for consistency)
1. Add the eggplant to the mixing bowl. Rub the mixture all over the eggplant—it should get a reddish hue as it absorbs the flavor from the harissa.
1. Grill on medium-high for ~10 minutes (5 minutes per side)
1. Enjoy!
