There are three main types of React Components. There are also (with the introduction of hooks in 16.8) three different ways to define / set state.

## Class / Pure Components

The types of components are very similar, though with key differences that should be borne in mind when choosing between them.<sup>[1](#Footnotes)</sup><a id="fn1"></a>

There are also two different ways to set state.

With a constructor:

```
class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      showForm: false
    };
  }
  ...
}
```

Without a constructor:<sup>[2](#Footnotes)</sup><a id="fn2"></a>

```
class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    showForm: false
  }
  ...
}
```

While these examples are for Class Components, the same syntax would work for a Pure Component (as long as it met the guidelines for what a pure component should be).

## Function Components

I havenâ€™t written a class component in months (which was part of the impetus to even remind myself of how they work) because I can now do almost everything Iâ€™ve wanted with a functional componentâ€¦ more simply.

For example, the same state within a functional component would be:

```javascript
function MyComponent (props){
  const [showForm, setShowForm] = useState(false)
  ...
}
```

## Final Thoughts

The big thing to remember about class components is that they need to be bound. Arrow functions receive their context at time of definition, not invocation, so thereâ€™s no need to bind them. Thereâ€™s also no need to bind a `setState` function from the `useState` hooks.

All of which, again, makes me love hooks more and more.
