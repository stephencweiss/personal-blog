I brought pomodori back this week after listening to the podcast episode with [Productivity with Mani Vaya](https://overcast.fm/+B1THOPAVc). Mani won me over early in the interview by citing Cal Newport as an influence and specifically Deep Work. I would have thought that Deep Work and pomodori wouldn’t be very compatible, since the latter creates disruptions every 25 minutes taking you out of the flow.

After buying a pomodoro timer for myself (~\$8 to get it to sync between my laptop and my phone), I find that there are really two major reasons why this concern is unfounded:

1. At Mani’s suggestion, during the breaks, I did _not_ check email, my phone, etc., but just got up and walked around a bit, got water, took a bio break, etc. Basically anything other than work but without allowing my attention to get sucked _into_ a different problem.
2. Assuming I do #1 correctly, then the breaks serve as a mini-Hemingway Stop for me. My brain keeps processing, but I’m forced to step away. That gives my brain a bit of a break, but when I come back, I know exactly where I stopped and can pick it back up quickly.

It took me a few days to actually add an intention for my pomodori, but since doing it, I’ve found them to be even more motivating. I _really_ want to finish the task in that 25 minutes - even though I know that I could just do another one after the break.

The final point here is that Mani has a “pomodoro challenge” he talked about - 200 minutes of pomodori before noon. That’s “just” eight pomodori. With breaks, it would mean you need to start around 7am in order to hit it. I didn’t. But, I did consistently hit a goal of 10 / day this week. We’ll see if I keep it going, but so far, am a big fan of how it keeps me focused and engaged.
