It’s clear from _What Unites Us: Reflections On Patriotism_, a collection of essay written by Dan Rather, the longtime CBS news correspondent, and Elliot Kirschner, that Rather comes from a time and place nearly unrecognizable today. Yet,  the America he describes is, in many ways, the the one I know and recognize. The love, so evident in how he speaks about the nation, is the same love I feel. In that way, at least, we are united. 

_What Unites Us_ reminds me of another book worth reading: Jill Lepore’s _This America_. Both are slim volumes born from the particular moment in American history. Both offer inclusionary, rather than exclusionary visions of America and Americans and neither dwell on the specifics of today. Both offer messages of hope and project confidence. Hope that even in the darkest moments, things will get better. Confidence in the laws and institutions of this grand experiment. In this way, I suspect both will long outlive the moment as sources of wisdom and comfort for readers. 

Unlike _This America_, _What Unites Us_ benefits greatly from the personal perspective of its author. _What Unites Us_ is all about Rather. Or rather, the lessons he’s learned over the course of a long and surely fascinating life. It’s Rather’s voice that supplies the gravitas to the pages that will pull you back down when the chaos of the moment seems ready to carry you away. It’s why, when the news of the day seem ready to knock you over, you firm your stance and listen when, just as Edward R Murrow did from the roofs of London during the Blitz, he says “Steady.”
