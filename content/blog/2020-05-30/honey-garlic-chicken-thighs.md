Several years ago, Alex Delaney published one of our favorite chicken recipe's over on [Bon Appetit's Basically column](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/crispy-chicken-thighs-rent-week).

While the chicken it produces is top notch, the recipe itself is a little hard to follow as it's written as a narrative.

Alex's version is more fun to read, but sometimes I just want to know what's next, so, for my future reference, I'm summarizing.

## Ingredients

- 5-6 skin on chicken thighs
- 1 head of garlic
- salt
- pepper
- olive oil
- 6 scallions
- 1/4 cup honey
- 3 tbsp. butter
- 1-2 oz. of white wine vinegar

## Overview

High level of what this recipe calls for:
- Oven roast garlic.
- Prepare the chicken.
- Pan fry the chicken.
- Make a honey-garlic sauce.
- Roast the chicken with the sauce on topic.
- Make a pan sauce to go on top.

## Directions

Step-by-step to make this delicious dish:

1. Heat the oven to 425°F
2. Place the head of garlic on an oven rack, wrapped in aluminum foil, allow to roast for ~30 minutes
3. Make sure the chicken is dry, salt and pepper both sides
4. Thinly slice the scallions - separate the white roots from the green shoots.
5. Heat a skillet over medium-low.
6. Once the skillet is warm, brush the chicken thighs with olive oil, place them skin side down into the skillet for ~5 minutes (fat should render on the bottom of the pan)
7. Readjust the thighs so that the fat is underneath the thighs - cook for additional 10 minutes.
8. Turn off the heat, add the white scallions to the skillet, and flip the chicken over (skin side up)
9. Take the garlic from the oven, allow to cool (~5 minutes)
10. Slice the head of garlic in half, and squeeze the garlic into a bowl, mash into a "paste"
11. Add ~1/4 cup of honey to the bowl and mix until blended.
12. Spread the garlic-honey mixture on top of the chicken thighs (a thin layer only)
13. Place the skillet into the oven and cook until the honey is caramelized and the chicken is at 165°F.
14. Remove the chicken thighs from the skillet and place the skillet back on the stove
15. Melt the 3 tbsp. of butter in the skillet and add the remaining honey-garlic mixture as well as the white wine. This makes a pan sauce that can be drizzled on top.

Serve the chicken, garnished with the green onions and drizzled with the pan sauce.Enjoy.
