This spring I read the Jason Zweig updated version of Benjamin Graham’s [*The Intelligent Investor*](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661), the follow up to his more technical [*Security Analysis*](https://www.amazon.com/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539). The book is full of wisdom, but what I love most about it is how accessible it is.

I came away from that book with a different goal for investing. Instead of trying to beat the general market (something which I’m convinced takes a lot of skill *and* attention), I now just want *enough*.

Everyone’s going to have a different definition of what enough is, but when enough is the goal, it discourages frequent intervention.

As the saying goes:

> "An investment portfolio is like a bar of soap: The more you touch/handle it, the smaller it gets"

The problem is that I *want* to tinker. Investing is a lot like a game. One that produces a few winners and a lot of losers.

To curb that desire, I followed one of Graham’s pieces of advice - sign an investment contract that governs when and what you’ll invest in. It’s a single page document and I keep it next to my bed, pulling it off the shelf as often as I need to remind me to stay the course.

(H/t to [Rohan Rajiv](https://alearningaday.com/2018/08/23/investments-and-soap/) for resurfacing the quote and [Barry Popik](https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/an_investment_portfolio_is_like_a_bar_of_soap_the_more_you_touch_it_the_sma) for digging into the source)

P.S. For anyone who's interested - here's a PDF of the [Investment Owner’s Contract](/?attachment_id=940) you can print and sign for yourself.
