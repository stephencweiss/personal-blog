When it comes to accessibility (a11y) on the web, one of the best / easiest things you can do is to use _semantic_ HTML.

> Structural, semantic HTML is the key starting point toward good accessibility practices.¹

That means, when you want to have something be clickable, use a `<button>`. If it's the top header, use `<h1>`. The next header should be `<h2>`, not `<h3>`, etc.

Buttons, however, often pose a problem. They’re the best way to indicate interactivity, but they come with a lot of built-in styling that may not be aligned with the style of your website.

One easy solution is to simply make a `<div role="button">` with an `onClick` event handler.

A better solution is create a base button that is “styleless”.

While not a _perfect_ solution (see CSS Tricks for some caveats²), the following is a good start:

```css
.stylelessButton {
  font-size: 100%;
  font-family: inherit;
  border: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background: transparent; // Firefox
}
```

This will strip out the majority of the CSS that makes a button look different than what it’s around and can serve as a nice base on which to build.
