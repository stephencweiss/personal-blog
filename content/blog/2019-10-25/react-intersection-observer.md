I was reviewing a project recently that made use of the `react-intersection-observer` library and was fascinated by the simplicty of the API - particularly the hooks version.<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup><a id="fn1"></a>

You pass in intersection options and it returns:

- a `ref` which can be passed along to the component for tracking purposes
- `inView` a boolean that evaluates whether the component is or is not in view
- `entry`, which is the `IntersectionObserverEntry`, which "describes the intersection between the target element and its root container at a specific moment of transition."<sup>[2](#footnotes)</sup><a id="fn2"></a>

A simple use case (the repo has better examples) to see how it can be used:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer'

const Container = props => {
  const { scrollDirection } = props

  const [ref, inView] = useInView({
    rootMargin:
      '-' +
      String(
        window.innerHeight * (scrollDirection === 'scrollingDown' ? 0.25 : 0.4)
      ) +
      'px',
  })

  return <div ref={ref}>{inView && props.children}</div>
}

export default React.memo(Container)
```

In this case, we didnâ€™t need access to `entry`, but instead toggle the children on/off based on whether or not the containing `div` is `inView` (which in this case means either 25% or 40% of it is visible depending on the direction of scroll).
