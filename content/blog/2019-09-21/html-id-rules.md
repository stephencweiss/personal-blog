Ids are everywhere. But what are the rules for them?

Turns out, the rules in HTML5 are pretty permissive: unique, at least one character, and no spaces.<sup>1</sup>

From the spec itself:<sup>2</sup>

> When specified on [HTML elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#html-elements) , the [id](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-id-attribute) attribute value must be unique amongst all the [IDs](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-id) in the elementâ€™s [tree](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree) and must contain at least one character. The value must not contain any [ASCII whitespace](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-whitespace).

The rules used to be more specific. In HTML4<sup>3</sup>:

> **ID** and **NAME** tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("\_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").

Note the restrictions as well as the fact that the id _had_ to start with a letter.
