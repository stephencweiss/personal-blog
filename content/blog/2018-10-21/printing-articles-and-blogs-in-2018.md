There are more free resources out there today than ever before. For a student, it’s a glorious time.

Despite the rise of great annotating tools ([Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u), [Highly.co](https://www.highly.co/) \- both of which I use regularly), I still find it helpful to read and annotate on paper depending on the content.

Getting there though is surprisingly difficult as websites have de-prioritized making it simple.

Take Medium.com for example. A few years ago, Marcin Wichary wrote about [designing Medium’s print experience](https://medium.design/printing-medium-stories-89f381b903c9) to translate articles from the web to the page. Today, that feature doesn’t exist.

Medium’s not alone. Try printing just about any website using `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P` and you'll likely be in for a bad time.

I came across a pretty simple solution though: the reader view. Reader view comes built into Safari, Firefox. On Chrome, you will need an extension - I’ve been using [Reader View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-view/ecabifbgmdmgdllomnfinbmaellmclnh/related?hl=en) and enjoy it so far.

By stripping away "clutter", these methods create clean webpages that are much simpler to print, emphasize the text, not the page styling. It also means a much nicer layout for printing - wider margins, readable font sizes (because you don't need to resize the page), etc.

# The steps:

  1. Load up the article, blogpost, etc. in the Reader View
  2. Print
  3. Enjoy reading again.

# A video tutorial
I put together this 3 minute video showing how to use the Reader View in Chrome and Safari and highlighting the difference it makes for several websites.
