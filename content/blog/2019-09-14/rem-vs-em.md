Jeremy Church put together a nice little side by side comparison of REM and Em (and PX).<sup>1</sup>

Both REM and EM are relative units. The difference is in _what_ they’re relative _to_.
* EM is relative to the parent.
* REM is relative to the root (hence the R).

From Jeremy:
> While**em**is relative to the font size of its direct or nearest parent,**rem**is only relative to the `html` (root) `font-size`. I like to think of it as a reset. If a style sheet is built in a modular fashion, then**rem**shouldn’t be needed very often, but it can be handy at times.
