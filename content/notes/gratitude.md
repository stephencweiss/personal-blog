Over the holidays I read Dr. Stanley's opinion in the Wall Street Journal, [A Thank-You Note Helped Me Find My Calling](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-thank-you-note-helped-me-find-my-calling-11577484308).

This quote about how to see people for who they are and understand their values has stuck with me.

> You can tell a lot about a man by what he laughs at. So, while you're visiting with us, judge us on what makes us jolly and learn what makes us thankful. Our gratiitude reveals our values.
> -- Michael PH Stanley, paraphrasing Hughlings Jackson
