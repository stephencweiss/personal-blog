In a guided meditation on Calm, Tamara Levitt relays one of my favorite parables.

It's the story of a farmer and his fortune and demonstrates how to handle uncertainty and the benefits of impermanence.

The story illustrates the wisdom embodied by the phrase "this too shall pass."

> There once was a farmer who’s horse ran away. When his neighbors heard the news, they came over to express their condolences. "How terrible! Your horse has run away," they said.
>
> "Perhaps," the farmer replied.
>
> The next day, the horse returned and brought with him three wild horses.
>
> The farmer’s neighbors came to the farm and declared, "What good fortune you have!"
>
> "Perhaps," the farmer replied.
>
> The next day, the farmer’s son rode one of the wild horses. The horse threw him from his back and the son broke his leg. He would walk with a limp for the rest of his life.
>
> "What bad fortune you have!" The neighbors declared to the farmer.
>
> "Perhaps," the farmer replied.
>
> A few weeks later, the army came through the village to recruit young, able-bodied men. Seeing the son’s limp, they passed him by.
>
> "What good fortune you have!" the neighbors decreed.
>
> "Perhaps," the farmer replied.
