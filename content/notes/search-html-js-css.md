As one of the fortunate few (relatively) who learned to make websites _after_ the ascendency of React, I find that I often struggle when thrust into an environment where I need to use the browser APIs.

The component model of React and how it’s composed together to create a full UI makes sense to me at this point.

But, because I use React to hook into a single root element and fill it in with React elements, it’s easy to lose sight of what’s actually happening and how it might translate to a world of _static_ HTML.<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup>

I really liked going back to the basics. It was both a testament to how much I’d forgotten _and_ how much I have learned.

While I didn’t remember some of the simplest things when I started, I was able to pick it back up quickly. Even better, the exercise helped me understand _better_ some of the things that React does for me.
