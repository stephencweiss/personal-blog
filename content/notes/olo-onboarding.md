things they've done right

(beyond competitive offer, etc.)

1. welcome email from hr with a deck of what to expect
1. welcome email from manager - expressing enthusiasm and excitement - encouraging _relaxing_ before the job starts (i.e. don't feel like you need to get involved in the emails, etc.)
1. welcome emails from future team members - quick intros and excitement
1. tech is all shipped in advance and arrived well in advance
1. email from IT on how to set up computer (even when processes change in flight, they're over communicative)
1. fitbit - with a note "welcome to team olo"
1. swag package - "welcome to the team"

none of this is _hard_, but it's hard to find it all in one place.
