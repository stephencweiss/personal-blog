Culture is defined by action. Culture is what allows employees to know _what_ to do given a situation. It's a shared understanding of how the company operates. It's not something that comes from an employee handbook or diktat on high.

To shift a culture then requires emphasis. If you want to promote frugality, don't write about it in the monthly newsletter. Or don't _just_ write about it. Call out the successful cost saving measures employees have taken. Show case those employees and reward them. And then keep at it. Changing culture takes time.

It doesn't need to be subliminal. It's okay if employees see it coming. The point is not to trick employees into a culture. It's to get everyone on the same page so that leaaders don't need to be in the room to make every decision. Culture takes care of that.
