When React Dev Tools v4 landed the feature to highlight updated components disappeared.

It's true that focusing only on re-renders can be inappropriate as [Dan Abramov explains on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/cqx554/introducing_the_new_react_devtools/ex1r9nb/):

> [Highlight Updates] contributes to the wrong idea that re-renders by themselves are bad (they're not if they're cheap). So people spend time optimizing useless things and missing actual performance issues.

None the less - it can be useful to quickly check whether components are rendering as expected.

In looking for an alternative, I discovered that the Chrome dev tools actually have a very similar feature (albeit not React specific) as part of their [performance analyzing suite](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance).

Quick steps to use turn it on:

1. Open your dev tools (`âŒ¥ Alt + âŒ˜ Cmd + I`)
2. Open the Command Palette (`âŒ˜ Cmd + â‡§ Shift+P`) in the dev tools.

3. Turn on "Show Rendering"

4. Select the options you want

5. Update the page and watch it paint live.

(Update Highlights were brought back in [React Dev Tools v4.2](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16989). Woohoo!ðŸŽ‰)
