Previously, I wrote about writing a GraphQL query that takes variables.

I was using this to programmatically create posts.

In returning to that post later, however, I noticed that I actually forgot a relevant detail: how to test it in GraphiQL, the playground Gatsby provides.

Continuing with the same example we used last time, you can see at the bottom left of the screen a "Query Variables" option.

Clicking on it exposes an input window.

In my case, my only variable is a string for the argument `$slug`. To pass an option, I create an object with `slug` as the key and whatever value I want.

For example:

```javascript
{"slug": "hello-world"}
```

Note: Itâ€™s important to put quotes around Slug or it will error.
