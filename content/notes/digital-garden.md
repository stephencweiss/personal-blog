I've been feeling this for so long but never had the words for it.

it turns out that a lot of my dissatisfaction is the idea that things need to happen daily.

For the better part of the past two years I've built a pretty consistent habit of writing. I write about all sorts of things and publish them here - lately, it's been mostly technical in nature, but I also have a habit of thinking about economics, education, business, and what a good life looks like.

The problem is that I've felt more and more (self-imposed) pressure to write about technical things and "produce content" - which is not and never was the intention of having this site. I have never had google analytics (i think i tried to set it up once, but gave up quickly) on my site or facebook pixels.

I want to write because writing is how I have a conversation - with myself and with others. It's how I form and explore ideas.

Joel Hooks redesigned his site to be about curation for what he describes as his [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). It's an idea I've thought about for several years - ever since reading Jaron Lanier's _You Are Not A Gadget_. I missed too much of Web 1.0 and its quirkiness personally to speak about it from personal experience, however, reading about it and the personality that was embedded in each person's site is something I aspire to.

Reframing how I think about this site from a "blog" - a chronological log of daily passings to a garden opens up a number of opportunities for organization.

what am i growing in my digital garden?

-   technical posts that form a bit of a personal wiki
-   recipes (sometimes I like to cook and i have a terrible memory)
-   musings about life and economics
-   reflections on my performance, life, and business
-   aspirationally - free writing

it doesn't make a lot of sense to organize these by date, but also thinking that these are the _only_ categories that i ever want to write / ideas i want to plant is short sighted and limiting.

so, i'm trying to step back and think about things differently. it's okay if i open a new section and as Joel Hooks says, it may "wither and die"

so why have dates at all? dates _are_ important because they provide context, even if it's hard to decipher. a post about uncertainty in 2020 vs one in 2019 is different.

so, i hope this new site is more like walking in a garden - exploring topics that might be interesting and quickly jumping to related material.

this little corner of the internet is for me - so if you visit, i hope you find it both pleasant and hospitable, but it's also not _for_ you. it's for me. it's a place for me to write, to explore, to think, to remember.

[writing is a conversation](writing-is-just-the-beginning) - that's why i have email. one day i'll also build a

my atomic unit is a post - it includes the material, the thoughts put down on the page to communicate an idea, learning, lesson, etc. It includes tags - ways to associate an idea and a category - a project file. Being digital, there's no actual limit for the number of categories or tags.

notes are supposed to be digitally findable.
