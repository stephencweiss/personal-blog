For a long time, my site has been fueled by a single graphql query. The site is a single page that is a running list of all my blog posts.

The more I write, the more unwieldy the site becomes. While adding search helped, I've got plans to add pagination and other pages in the future.

Before that could become a reality, I needed a way to pull back different data in different contexts.

That is, in order to create a page for each blog entry, I needed to retrieve the actual blog entry. However, to create a list of 10 blog entries, I needed the title and a slug.

The problem was that they were coming from the same place and without aliasing, that leads to errors. Fortunately, aliasing the query provided a solution.

Let's take a look.

To begin, I had this query in my `gatsby-node`.

```graphql
query BlogPosts {
    allMarkdownRemark(
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
        filter: { fields: { isPublished: { eq: true } } }
        limit: 1000
    ) {
        edges {
            node {
                fields {
                    slug
                }
                frontmatter {
                    title
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The results of this query are a series of edges, like so:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "allMarkdownRemark": {
            "edges": [
                {
                    "node": {
                        "fields": {
                            "slug": "/2019-11-27/running-shell-scripts/"
                        },
                        "frontmatter": {
                            "title": "Shell Scripts: How To Run Them"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "node": {
                        "fields": {
                            "slug": "/2019-11-25/psql-tuples-only/"
                        },
                        "frontmatter": {
                            "title": "Postgres Tuples Only"
                        }
                    }
                }
                // ...
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

These were then passed into a `createPage` action which used my `blogPost` template to generate a post for each edge.

## Adding Pagination

The [Gatsby tutorial on pagination](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-pagination/) was my starting point for learning about pagination on Gatsby.

The result is a query that looks nearly identical to retrieving _all_ posts, but includes a limit (i.e. the maximum number of results to return), and a skip (i.e. how many of the results to skip initially).

```graphql
query PaginatedBlogPosts($skip: Int!, $limit: Int!) {
    allMarkdownRemark(
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
        limit: $limit
        skip: $skip
    ) {
        edges {
            node {
                fields {
                    slug
                }
                frontmatter {
                    title
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Putting The Pieces Together

Okay, so I now have my paginated results, but I still need all of the results in order to create the pages for the blog posts.

Unfortunately, if I go ahead and and put these queries together, things break:

```graphql
query CombinedQuery {
    allMarkdownRemark(
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
        filter: { fields: { isPublished: { eq: true } } }
        limit: 3
    ) {
        edges {
            node {
                fields {
                    slug
                }
                frontmatter {
                    title
                }
            }
        }
    }
    allMarkdownRemark(
        filter: { fields: { isPublished: { eq: true } } }
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
        limit: $limit
        skip: $skip
    ) {
        edges {
            node {
                fields {
                    slug
                }
                frontmatter {
                    title
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Fortunately, tools like GraphiQL will show you something's afoot.

> Fields "allMarkdownRemark" conflict because they have different arguments. use different aliases on the fields to fetch both if this was intentional.

            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Aliases As The Solution

So, if both queries are needed, but running them together creates errors, what is the solution? Aliases!

```graphql
query combinedQuery($skip: Int!, $limit: Int!) {
    paginatedResults: allMarkdownRemark(
        filter: { fields: { isPublished: { eq: true } } }
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
        limit: $limit
        skip: $skip
    ) {
        edges {
            node {
                fields {
                    slug
                }
                frontmatter {
                    title
                }
            }
        }
    }
    publishedResults: allMarkdownRemark(
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
        filter: { fields: { isPublished: { eq: true } } }
    ) {
        edges {
            node {
                fields {
                    slug
                    isPublished
                }
                frontmatter {
                    title
                    date
                    publish
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, the first query of `allMarkdownRemark` is aliased to `paginatedResults` and the second to `publishedResults`.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "paginatedResults": {
            "edges": [
                {
                    //  ...
                }
                // ...
            ]
        },
        "publishedResults": {
            "edges": [
                {
                    // ...
                }
                // ...
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Once aliased, it's important to remember that the data is no longer accessible through `data.allMarkdownRemark`, but `data.paginatedResults` and `data.publishedResults`.

## Wrap-Up

If you need data from the same field in two different ways, GraphQL will yell... unless you provide an alias. And since they're simple to use, might as well!

Learning GraphQL - one bite at a time!
