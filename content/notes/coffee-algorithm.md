One way to understand an algorithm is as a recipe. A set of instructions, that if followed, will yield an anticipated result.

The example that [CS50 at Harvard used (based on the published videos on YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euFj8D1A1Kw) is of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

When I was first learning to code, I decided that I would write a coffee algorithm.

Apparently, I was writing in Python at the time, because my first attempt began with:

```python
Class BrewCoffee(self,water,coffee,brew_type, grinder, filter, mug)
	__init__.self()
	self.water = water
	self.coffee = coffee
	self.brew_type = brew_type
	#... the grinder, filter, and mug are dynamic and are dependent on the coffee and brew_type
```

Making the perfect cup of coffee really is a blend of art and science.

The way you pour water, letting the beans bloom, making sure to have a consistent drip - it's all important. But it can all be for naught if you ignore appropriate ratios.

When brewing with a Chemex, my preferred method, I've found my preferred ratio is 16:250 coffee to water.

A quick reference then is as follows:

| # of Cups | Beans (oz) | Water (oz) |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1         | 16         | 250        |
| 2         | 32         | 500        |
| 3         | 48         | 750        |

|                                                                   ![chemex patent](https://res.cloudinary.com/scweiss1/image/upload/v1587303251/code-comments/chemex-patent-poster-1943-sheet2-detail_1_qqzt0j.png)                                                                   |

| I found the patent drawings for the chemex to be quite stunning. This one comes from the [Chemex Store](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/patent-poster-1943-sheet-2.html), but you can find all of the original [patent filings here](http://fantes.net/manuals/chemex-patents.pdf). |
