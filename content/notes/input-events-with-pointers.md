How can the necessity of handling different types of inputs (e.g., mouse, touch, and pen) by duplicating event handler logic? The Pointer Event makes a compelling case that it's a solid solution.

> Pointer Events provide all the usual properties present in Mouse Events (client coordinates, target element, button states, etc.) in addition to new properties for other forms of input: pressure, contact geometry, tilt, etc. <sup>[2](#Footnotes)</sup><a id="fn2"></a>

While Pointer Events are not yet supported by all browsers, there is wide adoption among major modern browsers (Safari being the major exception, though support is coming in v13).<sup>[3](#Footnotes)</sup><a id="fn3"></a>

This is a boon as pointer events will make the act of dealing with different input events much simpler.
