I was recently working on a project where I wanted a loading state while an API resolved.

Instead of testing with a live API, I wanted to be able to mock it.

An easy way to do that is to create a simple `waitFor` function that returns a `Promise` of a `setTimeout`. Then, await it.

For example:

```javascript
const waitFor = (ms) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms))

const onClick = async (event) => {
    await waitFor(1000)
    //normal handling of event
}
```

Now, we can see what the UI does for 1000ms instead of actually making the call. And, if we want, we can use that time to [freeze the UI by running the debugger](inspect-hoverable-event).
