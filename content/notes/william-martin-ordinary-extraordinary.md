The following is an excerpt from William Martin's _The Parent's Tao Te Ching: Ancient Advice for Modern Parents_.

> Do not ask your children<br/>
> to strive for extraordinary lives.<br/>
> Such striving may seem admirable,<br/>
> but it is the way of foolishness.<br/> > <br/>
> Help them instead to find the wonder<br/>
> and the marvel of an ordinary life.<br/>
> Show them the joy of tasting<br/>
> tomatoes, apples and pears.<br/>
> Show them how to cry<br/>
> when pets and people die.<br/>
> Show them the infinite pleasure<br/>
> in the touch of a hand.<br/> > <br/>
> And make the ordinary come alive for them.<br/>
> The extraordinary will take care of itself.<br/>

I read two editions of the [_Tao Te Ching_ last year](../../../list/bookshelf#september-2019), but I have to say that, while an amazing and inspiring text, I never felt the way I felt reading this passage from Martin's book.

This is not just good advice for parents. This is good advice for living.

Live fully. Live by example. Live ordinarily. Everyday there are pleasures enough for a wonderfully rich life, ripe for plucking. We just need to remember to look.
