Today in package discoveries:<sup>1</sup> [gray-percentage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-percentage).

It's a small utility written by [Kyle Matthews](https://github.com/KyleAMathews) (creator of Gatsby) that returns a hue of gray (with an optional mixin for a color).

Kyle used this in Typography.JS, a quick theming library, which is how I found it. However, `gray-percentage` is more generally useful to find alternatives to black (#000) (<https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/>).

Looking at the code, it also reminded me of the [complementary color generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stephencweiss/generate-complementary-colors) I published last year. The goal of that package was to use color theory to create complementary colors for use in data visualization (somewhat similar to a site like [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)).
