In early May, the New York Times ran a series of short [reader submitted anecdotes about the walks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/learning/do-you-enjoy-going-on-a-walk-especially-now.html).

Yevette Conklin's, a fellow Chicago resident, was particularly striking and beautiful to me.

And then I notice they were always there -- birds, insects, land animals, just doing what they do, these presents I get for being present, quiet and still.
