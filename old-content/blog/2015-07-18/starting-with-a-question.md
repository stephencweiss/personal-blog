This site starts with a question. It's a question about purpose, about direction, and about value - "Is this worth reading? Is it useful or interesting? In short, _so what_?"

There are billions of people on Earth and millions of blogs. To add my name to the ranks requires a degree of hubris - much more than I'm normally comfortable with. So, if I'm the guy who could never keep a sketch pad as a kid because the sketches weren't perfect or the one who starts projects only to drop them shortly thereafter because they're the kernel of an idea and not a fully developed one, why am I here? Well, for starters because I believe in constant improvement. Humans are plastic. We can be shaped (and improved). It doesn't happen overnight, it has to start somewhere, and 1% improvements1 can have massive effects in the long run. Austin Kleon, the source of the question for this site, provides another reason in his book, _Show Your Work!\_2:

> "The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others."

That's the crux. I'm endeavoring to learn and this is my commitment. I'm studying how to be a better friend, photographer, and writer. Even more than that, I want to be a better human. My question remains open. Maybe one day I'll have an answer, but for now, I'll just just do my best to share what I find  useful or interesting.
