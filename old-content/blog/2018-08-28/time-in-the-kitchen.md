I've been trying to pick up more of the cooking duties in our home and I've noticed that recipes often make a distinction between prep time and total time.

Most of the time this seems to _imply_ that the difference will be time that can be used doing other things. Though that's not always the case, my favorite recipes are those where the "cook" time is passive.

Take a cake for example - there’s the prep time. This will include mixing, blending, pouring, etc. Then there’s the cook time. The cake's in the oven and it just needs time. In fact, opening the door is counter productive.

That's my kind of recipe. To get the final product that you want, you _need_ to step away. It also means that you're now free to do other things.
