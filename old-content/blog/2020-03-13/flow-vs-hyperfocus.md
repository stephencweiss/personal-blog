On a recent episode of [The 6-Figure Developer Podcast](https://6figuredev.com/), [Matthew Jones](https://exceptionnotfound.net/) came on to talk about [distracted developers](https://6figuredev.com/podcast/episode-131-distracted-developer-with-matthew-jones/) and strategies for coping.

The entire conversation is worth a listen, but one part really stood out as I felt very seen. It was the distinction between [flow](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_flow_the_secret_to_happiness/transcript), that state so many folks strive to get into ([Cal Newport is a notable exception](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2012/04/09/the-father-of-deliberate-practice-disowns-flow/)) and a new term to me: hyper-focus.

Matthew drew the following distinction between the two:

1. Flow is the state of mind which induces a _desire_ to finish the task at hand
2. Hyper-focus is the state which induces a _compulsion_ to

He claims that the distinction is subtle (it's only different by one word), but I'd argue it's anything but subtle. As someone who apparently "suffers" from hyper-focus it's disastrous.

One of the best things you can do when you're stuck on a problem is to walk away. Hyper-focus prevents that. It's why on numerous occasions, I've gotten so sucked into work that I've missed dinner or stayed up all night - tweaking and tinkering. It's why my wife doesn't trust (and shouldn't) that I can wrap up a project when I say "just five more minutes"

Pomodoro is one strategy that I've employed for the better part of a year to help with this - but even then, if I miss a timer and forget to set a new one... there's no telling when I'll look up again.

I'd never heard of hyper-focus before. I have no idea if it's a "real" thing. What I do know is that I've seen it. I've felt it. And now, knowing it's name, I can deal with it head on.
