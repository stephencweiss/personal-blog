In [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/), one of the options is to run the tour offline.

The instructions seem simple enough:

1. Install Go
2. Run the command to fetch the tour

```shell
go get golang.org/x/tour
```

3. Run the binary that's placed in the workspace's `bin` directory.

First things first: `workspaces` seem to have been deprecated with the introduction of modules in v1.13+.<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup><a id="fn1"></a>

Why does any of this matter? Because when I followed the instructions:

```shell
stephen@Stephens-MBP-2 ~ % go get golang.org/x/tour
stephen@Stephens-MBP-2 ~ % $HOME/go/bin/tour
```

The tour successfully downloaded, and I was able to run the binary... but, I couldn't execute anything.

Trying to run the `Hello, world`, I got the message: `Program exited: signal: killed`.

Womp, womp.

## Debugging The Issue

First, let's look at a few things:

1. The [instructions to install Go (on Mac)](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.14.1.darwin-amd64.pkg) indicate that by following the wizard, `/usr/local/go/bin` should be automatically available in the `PATH`. Checking that, it appears that's true!

```shell
$ echo $PATH
/Users/stephen/.nvm/versions/node/v12.16.1/bin:/Users/stephen/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/go/bin:/Users/stephen/.cargo/bin
```

2. But when I saved the tour (with the `go get`), where did that save and install? _Not_ in `/usr/local/go`, but `/Users/stephen/go` - this is because that's my `GOPATH` value:

```shell
$ go env
...
GOBIN=""
GOPATH="/Users/stephen/go"
GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
...
```

In my haste to get started, I didn't fully comprehend Go's [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html), specifically, in describing the installation of a `hello.go` it reads:

> ```shell
> $ go install example.com/user/hello
> $
> ```
>
> This command builds the `hello` command, producing an executable binary. It then installs that binary as `$HOME/go/bin/hello` (or, under Windows, `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin\hello.exe`).
> The install directory is controlled by the `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` [environment variables](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Environment_variables) . If `GOBIN` is set, binaries are installed to that directory. If `GOPATH` is set, binaries are installed to the `bin` subdirectory of the first directory in the `GOPATH` list. Otherwise, binaries are installed to the bin subdirectory of the default `GOPATH` (`$HOME/go` or `%USERPROFILE%\go`).

What's all this mean? Well, it means that by default, the Go binaries will be saved in `/Users/stephen/go/bin`, (which is also often written as `$HOME/go/bin` or `~/go/bin`).

### Side Note: Simpler Go Execution

We can make executing Go binaries a much simpler process then by adding this to our [PATH](../../2020-04-15/path-variable-modifying), like so:

```txt:title=.zshrc
...
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin" # This adds User Installed Go Binaries to PATH
```

Okay, so that makes it simpler to run the tour, which can now be done as:

```shell
$ go get golang.org/x/tour
$ tour
```

## Finding A Solution

None of these hold the answer, yet, however.

Even though it's now easier to _run_ the tour, it still doesn't actually execute the Go code.

To get it working, however, manually building and installing _does_ seem to work:

```
$ go get -d golang.org/x/tour // Not necessary if the source code is already in `$HOME/go/src`
$ cd $HOME/go/src/golang.org/x/tour
$ go build
$ go install
$ tour
```

Credit to [Michael DuBose](https://github.com/mhdubose) for this workaround, which I found on [this Github issue](https://github.com/golang/tour/issues/866#issuecomment-576387197).

Regarding the `-d` flag for `go get`:

> The -d flag instructs get to download the source code needed to build
> the named packages, including downloading necessary dependencies,
> but not to build and install them.

With that being the case, manually building and installing is necessary, but it works!

And now, I can get to actually _learning_ Go!

## Footnotes

-   <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> Evidence of this conclusion is that [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html), which is where the link in the welcome section of [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/3) takes you, no longer has a section on workplaces. You can find it in the archived version, however: ([How to Write Go Code (with GOPATH) - The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code.html#Workspaces)).
