I've been working on putting together a new theme for my website. In the process, I decided that I wanted to avoid the edges of the color box (i.e. no pure white or black) while supporting a light mode and a dark mode.

That meant I needed a way to come up with complementary colors as well as the inverse.

While sites like coolors.co are great for coming up with a nice set of colors, they're less helpful when you have a specific color and you're looking for it's inverse.

[Pinetools.com](https://pinetools.com/c-colors/), on the other hand, has a bunch of tools for exactly these types of purposes. The color tools include:

-   Lighten Color
-   Darken Color
-   Change Color Saturation
-   GreyScale/Desatureate A Color
-   Invert A Color
-   Random Color Generator
-   Blend Color
-   Gradient Generator
-   Shift Hue of A Color
-   Triad Color Scheme
-   Tetrad Color Scheme
-   Complementary Color
-   Split Complementary Colors
-   Analogous Color Scheme
-   Monochormatic Colors Generator
-   Square Color Scheme
-   Image Color Picker
-   Get Colors From Image

I haven't tried them all, but the invert and complementary color tools worked like a charm!

Thanks to [Sung M. Kim](https://sung.codes/) as I found pinetools when looking through [his website's source code](https://github.com/dance2die/sung.codes/blob/master/src/theme.js)
