In _Thinking In Bets_, Annie Duke argues that if your goal is to make an optimal decision, you would be well served by divorcing the message from the messenger. In fact, most of Chapter 5, ["Dissent To Win"](../../../books/thinking-in-bets#chapter-5-dissent-to-win) focuses on the topic and I think she makes a compelling case.

Duke's book however is a framework for managing risk to achieve the best outcomes. It willfully disregards the emotional reactions people have because they are counter productive _despite_ the prevalence of emotional reactions among most people. That's not fair. _All_ people react emotionally. Duke is not arguing otherwise. Instead, she's presenting a methodology for managing that.

What if you're on the _other side_ of the table. Instead of trying _not_ to be persuaded, you are trying to persuade? You might pick up a book like Robert B. Cialdini's classic, _Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion_ and realize that so much of bringing someone along is creating an emotional reaction.

That's what I was thinking about when I read Rohan Rajiv's recent post on [Trombone Oil](https://alearningaday.blog/2020/01/10/trombone-oil/) (the full post copied below), the tile of which is a reference to a Dan Burke quip to Bob Iger.

Rajiv closed his post with this:

> Even if what we’re saying is incredibly valuable, how we say it can make or break its impact.

I couldn't have said it better myself.
