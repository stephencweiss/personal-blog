I recently heard about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. According to Wikipedia, the hypothesis, "is a principle claiming that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus people's perceptions are relative to their spoken language."<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup><a id="fn1"></a>

Continuing from Wikipedia:

> The principle is often defined in one of two versions: the strong hypothesis, which was held by some of the early linguists before World War II,[1] and the weak hypothesis, mostly held by some of the modern linguists.[1]
>
> -   The strong version says that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories.
> -   The weak version says that linguistic categories and usage only influence thought and decisions.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis reminds me of the benefits that accrue from learning. That is, when I learn a new concept (such as a new word), I have a new tool in my toolset with which to approach problems. It literally opens up new pathways in how I think and broadens the landscape of what's possible.

Side Note: I suspect that the way new words provide new tools is part of the appeal for untranslatable words (e.g., [sisu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisu)<sup>[2](#footnotes)</sup><a id="fn2"></a>, [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), etc.). They expand our awareness and in that way help shake up our ways of thinking about problems to arrive at new conclusions.<sup>[3](#footnotes)</sup><a id="fn3"></a>

## Footnotes

-   <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> [Linguistic Relativity | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity)
-   <sup>[2](#fn2)</sup> I first heard about Sisu from James Clear's post [Sisu: How to Develop Mental Toughness in the Face of Adversity](https://jamesclear.com/sisu-mental-toughness).
-   <sup>[3](#fn3)</sup> There are a number of sites that aggregate these untranslatable words. Two that I like are [Eunoia.world](https://eunoia.world/), a personal project of [Steph Smith](https://stephsmith.io/), and [Untranslatable.org](http://www.untranslatable.org/), which seems to have gone quiet, but has a fairly large catalogue of words.
