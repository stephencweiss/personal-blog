Tonight, had a real head scratcher: how to instantiate a class in Typescript that uses a constructor without a compiler error!

In Vanilla JS, this works just fine:

```javascript:title=person.js
export class Person {
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name
    }
    age = 0
    setAge(age: number) {
        this.age = age
    }
}

let joe = new Person('joe')
joe.setAge(22)
console.log(joe.name, joe.age) // joe 22
```

But, if you were to use this in Typescript, the compiler would yell, saying `name does not exist on type 'Person'`.

I'll admit, I was stumped for a while.

```typescript:title=person.ts
export class Person {
    name = '' //highlight-line
    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name
    }
    age = 0
    public setAge(age: number) {
        this.age = age
    }
}

let joe = new Person('joe')
joe.setAge(22)
console.log(joe.name, joe.age) // joe 22
```

The solution is simple in the end, albeit certainly unintuitive to me - Add a default value and then override that value within the constructor!

Here's a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/embed/distracted-meadow-t3lmh?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark) to prove the point.

Sometimes solutions are simpler than I give them credit for - though if anyone has a _better_ way to do this, or a rationale for what's happening here that I'm missing, I'm all ears!
