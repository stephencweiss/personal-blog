The longer you do something, the more you grow and get better, the harder it can be to see progress.

While I believe the above to be generally true, I noticed it recently when working out.

Over the past year, I've spent a lot of time in the pool and on the erg (workout log) with only a few bike workouts here and there.

Last night, I hopped on the Peloton bike for a 30 minute "easy" ride. Allowing myself to get a little competitive with the other folks riding with me and, perhaps more importantly, my former self, I ended the workout with a new personal record.

The results were surprising because I didn't feel like I was in particularly good shape - and yet, there I was - staring at a marker of progress.

It was a good day.
