There's a lot I want to do. It feels like there's always something I _should_ or _could_ be doing.

When I feel like this, it's helpful to remember the role of prioritization.

Jason Fried, a co-founder of Basecamp, wrote a short piece entitled "Know No" which I found recently. It struck a chord.

> No is easier to do, yes is easier to say.
>
> Yes is no to a thousand things.
>
> No is a precision instrument, a surgeon's scalpel, a laser beam focused on one point. Yes is a blunt object, a club, a fisherman's net that catches everything indiscriminately.
>
> No is specific. yes is general.
>
> When you say no to one thing, it's a choice that breeds choices. Tomorrow you can be as open to new opportunities as you were today.
>
> When you say yes to one thing, you've spent that choice. The door is shut on a whole host of alternative possibilities and tomorrow is much more limited.
>
> When you say no now, you can come back and say yes later. If you say yes now, it's harder to say no later.
>
> No is calm but hard. Yes is easy but a flurry.
>
> Knowing what you'll say no to is better than knowing what you'll say yes to.
>
> Know no.
