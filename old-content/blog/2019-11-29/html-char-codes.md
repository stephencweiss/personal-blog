Recently, I went on a search to find a new arrow to use on my website (I settled on `&#10149;` which produces this: &#10149;).

In my search, I found this nice resource for [HTML Symbols, Entities and ASCII Character Codes](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/) from Toptal, the company behind connecting talented folks with companies for contract work.

The site lists the Unicode, Hex Code, HTML Code, and HTML Entity for a number of arrows, currencies, letters, math symbols, numbers, punctuation, and other symbols.
