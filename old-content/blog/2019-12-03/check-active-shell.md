If you [switch between shells](../../2019-09-02/change-default-shell-zsh), it might be handy to determine which one is currently running.

One way to do that is to check your process status (`ps` utility).

To find the process id (PID) of the current instance of your shell, use:

```shell
$ echo "$$"
```

You can then pass this into the `ps` utility to find a specific PID with the `-p` flag:

```shell
$ ps -p "$$"
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
21373 ttys001    0:00.69 -zsh
```
