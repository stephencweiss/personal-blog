What does it mean when we say that `babel` is a transpiler?

According to Shawn Wang (known on the internet as swxy), when `babel` transpiles, it "compile[s] from Javascript to Javascript".<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup><a id='fn1'></a>

So, if we're comparing transpiling to compiling - the former is from it's language to itself (at a target specified by the developer to be compatible with the consuming application â€” in this case the various browsers) while the latter is taking a language and transforming it into a _different_ language - whether it's a lower level language (C or C++) or machine code.
