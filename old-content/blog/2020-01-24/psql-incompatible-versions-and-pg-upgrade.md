I tried to start a PostgreSQL database yesterday from the command line and I was greeted with the error:

```shell
$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
waiting for server to start....2020-01-09 09:13:57.308 EST [49293] FATAL:  database files are incompatible with server
2020-01-09 09:13:57.308 EST [49293] DETAIL:  The data directory was initialized by PostgreSQL version 11, which is not compatible with this version 12.1.
 stopped waiting
pg_ctl: could not start server
Examine the log output.
```

I'm not sure _how_, but it seems that PostgreSQL was upgraded and while my data's safe, I need to update it to work with the new version of Postgres.

First, the good news: Postgres provides `pg_upgrade`<sup>1</sup> which makes fixing this problem _relatively_ straight forward.

## Steps

These steps are adapted by [10ninox](http://blog.10ninox.com/2015/01/psql-database-incompatible/)'s summary:

1. Make a backup of your existing library: `$ mv /usr/local/var/postgres /usr/local/var/postgres.backup`
2. Initialize a new database: `$ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres`
3. Make sure all Postgres servers are stopped and upgrade: `$ pg_upgrade -b /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/11/bin -B /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/12.1/bin -d /usr/local/var/postgres.backup -D /usr/local/var/postgres`<sup>2</sup>

The pattern here, from the docs, is: `$ pg_upgrade -b oldbindir -B newbindir -d olddatadir -D newdatadir`

At this point, you should be able to start your Postgres server and continue working!

## Footnotes and Resources

-   <sup>1</sup> The `pg_upgrade` manual page has a good tutorial and explanation. The options are copied below for 12.1.
-   <sup>2</sup> This is where I ran into problems. I couldn't actually locate the old executable (the `-b` option). In my case, I'm in a fortunate position where I don't actually need to retain the data, so, I could wipe everything and be okay. That won't always be the case though. With that in mind, I"m trying to dig into what actually happened and hope to have an update in the future.
