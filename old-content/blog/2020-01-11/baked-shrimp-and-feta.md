A family favorite is a variation on David Tanis' [Baked Greek Shrimp With Tomatoes and Feta Recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016693-baked-greek-shrimp-with-tomatoes-and-feta) from NYTimes Cooking.

It's simple and tasty - simpler even with a few modifications.

## Highlight Of Changes

For the most part, we stay true to the original recipe, however a few simple changes make the dish even simpler to make:

1. No mint, mostly due to availability and ease.
2. Brine the shrimp in salt and/or white wine instead of olive oil.
3. Use canned tomatoes. We use San Marino whole tomatoes, though we used crushed recently and it was quite tasty.

## Ingredients

-   Extra-virgin olive oil
-   3 large shallots, diced, about 1 cup
-   4 garlic cloves, minced
-   Salt and pepper
-   White wine (optional)
-   2 pounds large ripe tomatoes
-   ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
-   1 ½ pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined
-   4 ounces Greek feta cheese
-   ½ teaspoon dried oregano

## Preparation

1. Put 4 tablespoons olive oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 to 8 minutes. Lower heat as necessary to keep mixture from browning.
2. Add tomatoes to skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring regularly, for ~10 minutes (or until tomoto mixture has reduced). Transfer mixture to a shallow baking dish (we use a 9"x13" Pyrex).
3. While tomatoes are reducing, put shrimp in a mixing bowl. Brine shrimp with salt and white wine. Stir to coat.
4. Once tomatoes are ready and transferred into the baking dish, arrange shrimp over tomato mixture in one layer. Crumble cheese over surface and sprinkle with oregano.
5. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until tomatoes are bubbling and cheese has browned slightly. Remove from oven and let dish rest for 5 minutes. Serve with bread, crackers, or alone.
