One of the reasons why I like meditation is that it helps me pause between feeling an emotion and reacting to it. That pause is helpful. However, if in that pause, I can _name_ the emotion, and do so _accurately_, I'm able to respond much more effectively.

I recently came across the "feel wheel" (also referred to as the "feeling circle"). Originally designed by [Dr. Gloria Wilcox](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/036215378201200411), the version I've come across was made by [Geoffrey Roberts](https://imgur.com/tCWChf6).

For example:

-   When bad becomes busy, which is better described as _rushed_, I could slow down.
-   When fearful becomes weakness, or more accurately, a feeling of worthlessness, I could challenge that conclusion and promote my own worth on the merits of my accomplishments.

The _next_ step is much clearer when I have a clearer understanding of _what_ I'm feeling.

Another approach, with a similar aim, is Robert Plutchik's [Wheel of Emotions](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Motivation_and_emotion/Book/2014/Plutchik%27s_wheel_of_emotions):
